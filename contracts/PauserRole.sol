/**
 * @dev This role allows the contract to be paused, so that in case something goes horribly wrong
 * during an ICO, the owner/administrator has an ability to suspend all transactions while things
 * are sorted out.
 *
 * NOTE: We have implemented a role model only the contract owner can assign/un-assign roles.
 * This is necessary to support enterprise software, which requires a permissions model in which
 * roles can be owner-administered, in contrast to a blockchain community approach in which
 * permissions can be self-administered. Therefore, this implementation replaces the self-service
 * "renounce" approach with one where only the owner is allowed to makes role changes.
 *
 * Owner is not allowed to renounce ownership, lest the contract go without administration. But
 * it is ok for owner to shed initially granted roles by removing role from self.
